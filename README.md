#  Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data using the R programming language. As a data analyst seeking to enhance my skills in statistical analysis and data visualization, this project serves as an opportunity to explore R's capabilities and create engaging visualizations to communicate the impact of the pandemic across various countries.
## Project Description
The project focuses on processing, analyzing, and visualizing COVID-19 data related to death cases and confirmed cases. The project utilizes R packages such as dplyr and ggplot2 to manipulate and visualize the data, providing insights into total death cases, mean death cases, and the proportion of death cases for each country.
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop my skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization using the R programming language. By working with real-world data, I aim to create visualizations that effectively communicate the impact of COVID-19 on different countries and gain hands-on experience with R's data handling and plotting capabilities.
# Software Demo video
# The project includes the following visualizations:
* Pie Chart: Displays the proportion of death cases by country.
* Bar Chart: Showcases death cases by country, enabling easy comparison between nations.
* point Charts: Displaying confirmed cases
  
# Development Environment
The primary tools used for this project include:
* RStudio: An integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed for working with the R programming language.
# R Packages:
* dplyr: A package for data manipulation and analysis.
* ggplot2:A powerful data visualization package based on the grammar of graphics.
* R-Language: A programming language specialized for statistical computing and graphics.
